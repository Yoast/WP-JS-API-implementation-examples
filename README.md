# WordPress JavaScript API implementation examples

## Welcome to the Yoast WordPress JavaScript API implementation examples repository
This repository contains all code related to the JavaScript API implementation tutorial series that can be found at [developer.yoast.com](https://developer.yoast.com).

Every post within the series has its own accompanying chapter in the repository, but with one exception: Chapter 0 only contains the initial configuration for the build tools that are being used throughout the series.
Use that chapter as a starting point if you want to code along with the series!
